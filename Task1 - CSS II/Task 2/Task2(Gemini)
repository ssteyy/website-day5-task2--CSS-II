## CSS Compilation: A Breakdown

**CSS compilation** is the process of transforming preprocessed CSS code (written in languages like Sass or Less) into standard CSS that browsers can understand. This compilation typically involves parsing the preprocessor code, evaluating its syntax, and generating the corresponding CSS output.

### How CSS Compilation Works with Preprocessors

1. **Parsing:** The preprocessor's compiler analyzes the source code, breaking it down into its constituent parts (e.g., variables, rules, mixins).
2. **Evaluation:** The compiler evaluates the code, resolving variables, applying mixins, and handling other preprocessor-specific features.
3. **Output Generation:** The compiler generates the equivalent standard CSS code, ensuring that the browser can interpret it correctly.

### Steps Involved in Compiling Sass to CSS

1. **Import Resolution:** The compiler resolves any imported Sass files.
2. **Variable Evaluation:** It replaces variables with their assigned values.
3. **Mixin Application:** Mixins are expanded and their rules are inserted into the appropriate places.
4. **Function Evaluation:** Built-in or custom functions are executed, and their results are used in the code.
5. **Nesting Resolution:** Nested rules are flattened into their equivalent CSS structure.
6. **Output Generation:** The final CSS code is generated, adhering to standard CSS syntax.

### Example: Sass to CSS Compilation

**Sass code:**

```scss
$primary-color: #007bff;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

**Compiled CSS:**

```css
.button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

In this example, the Sass code uses a variable for the primary color. The compiler replaces the variable with its value during compilation, generating the final CSS code.

**Note:** The specific compilation process and features may vary slightly between different preprocessors like Sass, Less, and Stylus. However, the general concept of parsing, evaluation, and output generation remains consistent.
